      <description>Hi everyone!
The first week has come to an end. Including the previous work, this is the summary of what I have done till now:
Work PR #17: Added DataDeps-based Integration tests. These were needed in order to check whether the Register Blocks we are generating using DataDepsGenerators.jl are in the format DataDeps.jl wants it to be. These tests were crucial as it gives a verification that DataDeps.jl is able to understand the generated Register Block output from DataDepsGenerators.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
I am Sebastin Santy, a third year undergrad at BITS Pilani K.K. Birla Goa Campus. My proposal for GSoC 2018 has been accepted under NumFOCUS [Julia Computing]. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on adding support for more data repositories to DataDepsGenerators.jl. DataDepsGenerators.jl is a support package for DataDeps.jl which helps in creating Register Blocks for DataDeps.jl. A Register Block is a chunk of julia code which describes the data to be downloaded.</description>
